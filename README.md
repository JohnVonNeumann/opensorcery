## Infrastructure
Seeing as the project is heavily reliant on Infrastructure (possibly moreso than usual, due to the major abstraction of it) I've included all the necessary setup components as well as the obvious code. My knowledge only covers AWS at this point in time.
### Sceptre
We use Sceptre to handle test infrastructure. You can find it located at `/sceptre`
